# Simple CLI tool to move your mouse to a specified position without animation for macOS.

### Motivation:
I was not able to run [cliclick](https://github.com/BlueM/cliclick) on macOS 15.x (neither it was able to be installed via `brew`, nor the binary from Releases on GitHub worked â€“ I've been geetting `Killed: 9` error right after running it, so decided to write my own tool.<br>
_I guess the `Killed: 9` error was appearing due to unsigned binary (developer account required). My binary is signed, so you will be easily able to run it._

I needed some CLI tool for moving my mouse because i wanted to make a tool for automating the process of creating screenshots for my macOS application.
I'm writing the screenshot making automation in AppleScript and it does not natively suppport the mouse movement.
To achieve the mouse movement with AppleScript you can run some external shell script (which is why I made this binary).

### How to run it:
1. Download the binary from the latest release
2. Convenience-wise i recommend you to put the binary to `/usr/local/bin/` on your macOS, so you don't need to write the full path to this tool each time you run it. You can do it like this: `sudo cp /path/to/downloaded/mouset /usr/local/bin/`
3. To get current coordinates run `mouset` (or full path to the binary. You will likely need the binary to Accessibility in System Settings.
4. To put your mouse to some position, just run `mouset {x} {y}`. Fox example: `mouset 100 400`, which will move your mouse to x: 100 and y: 100 position.

### Want to build it yourself?
1. Download this repository
2. Open termianl
3. `cd` into the downloaded repo like this: `cd /Users/kopyl/Downloads/mouset`
4. Run `swift run mouset` to just run it
5. Run `swift build` to just build it for debugging
6. Run `swift build -c release` to build it for release (like i did)
7. Run `swift build -c release --show-bin-path` to show the binary path of the just-built binary

### Want to share it with friends?
You need to ~~suffer~~ sign it first with a developer account (which costs $99 a year ðŸ¤¬). But in case you have it (like i do), here are the steps to do it:
1. First you must generate a certificate. To do it:<br>
  1.1. Open 'Keychain Access.app'. To do it:<br>
   1.1.1. You might open Spotlight, type 'Keychain' and select 'Keychain Access.app'. Or find it somewhere in `'/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Keychain Access.app'`<br>
 1.2. In the top left corner of the screen press 'Keychain Access' -> 'Certificate Assistant' -> 'Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority'<br>
 1.3. Enter the email<br>
 1.4. Save the certificate to disk<br>
2. Then you must download another certificate:<br>
  2.1. First go to https://developer.apple.com/account<br>
  2.2. Navigate to: Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles â†’ Certificates<br>
  2.3. Click âž• â†’ Developer ID Application â†’ Continue<br>
  2.4. Upload the certificate you got from the 'Certificate Assistant'<br>
  2.5. Download the certificate, double click it and make sure it appears in the 'Keychain Access' app on the 'My certificates' tab.<br>
  2.6. Now in Keychain Access, under "My Certificates", you should see something like `Developer ID Application: Mike Tyson (XXXXXXX)`. You need to save that ID in parentheses (XXXXXXX) for later<br>
3. Now create App-specific password on https://account.apple.com/account/manage , save the name you give (for example "codesign") and the password you get<br>
4. Run this command to save the credentials for the Apple Notary Service:
```
xcrun notarytool store-credentials "codesign" \
  --apple-id "miketyson@gmail.com" \
  --team-id "XXXXXXX" \
  --password "russ-ians-shou-lddi"
```
Of course don't forget to replace the "codesign" App-specific password name with yours you set in step 3, the Apple ID with yours, team ID with the one received in step 2.6 and the App-specific password you got from Apple in step 3.
5. Sign the binary with the certificate you just downloaded from the Apple Developer website by this command `codesign --timestamp --options runtime --sign "XXXXXXX" mouset`. Don't forget to rerplace the "XXXXXXX" with the ID saved in step 2.6. I got no output from this command, so don't freak out if you don't get it as well<br>
6. Create zip archive of the signed app like this: `zip -r mouset.zip mouset`
7. Send the archive to Apple Notary Service with this command:
```
xcrun notarytool submit mouset.zip --keychain-profile "codesign" --wait
```
replacing the keychain-profile name with yours (in case you have it different from mine).
8. Now you should see something like "Accepted". If you did, congratulations, just send your archive to your friends.
