# Simple CLI tool to move your mouse to a set position.

#### Motivation:
I was not able to run [cliclick](https://github.com/BlueM/cliclick) on macOS 15.x (neither it was able to be installed via `brew`, nor the binary from Releases on GitHub worked â€“ I've been geetting `Killed: 9` error right after running it, so decided to write my own tool.
